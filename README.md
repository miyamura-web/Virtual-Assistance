# 🎙️ Goyank - Personal Voice Assistant
Goyank is a desktop-based AI voice assistant built with Python, using `Tkinter` for GUI, `SpeechRecognition` for voice commands, `pywhatkit` for YouTube integration, and `win32com.client` for voice output. It can interact with users, play music, search Wikipedia, open files/software, and much more — all through natural speech.
